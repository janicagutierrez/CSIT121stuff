            <h3>Why use a GIF?</h3>
            <p>These are used to show a repeating scene from a show, movie, cartoon, or video which is endlessly looped. As this is mainly used for memes, reactions, or simple design graphics users can identify. It may look kind of blurry which is fine as this can be pasted from a recording which can downplay the quality of said GIF and has no audio to it as well.</p>
