    <h2> Labs 1 & 2</h2>
    <p><i> Published on September 2025 by Janica Gutierrez</i></p>
    <p>This is my first webpage! Starting the process was not that hard as I took a smiliar class back in high school so I had prior knowledge about making websites through HTML codes. But, I am still learning new ways when using HTML or remembering how to. As of right now, I am properly learning on how to make my webpages from scratch through HTML and adapting new styles.</p>
    <h3>What I learned</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Structuring my webpage more neatly. Meaning, using different headers so it is easier to section off different topics.</li>
        <li>Inserting various of lists to make a more neater and simpiler look.</li>
        <li>Using the "a href" code to insert links where a user can click on it. This is very handy as I can link different sources in a webpage.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Learning about structuring, listings, and links was very exciting and useful to know! As I learnt alot from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Structuring_documents">HTML Semantic Elements by w3 Schools</a></p></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">HTML Links Hyperlinks by w3 Schools</a></li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Lab 3</h2>
        <p><i>Published on September 27, 2025</i></p>
        <p>This section, Lab 3, is all about the knowledge that I have about CSS, webpages, and HTML coding methods. I would say my prior knowledge about webpage design has increased since high school as I learnt different methods to use such as listings, colors, fonts, and etc to make my webpages more cohessive and neat.</p>
        <p>Using both the powerpoints provided within the course and websites such as w3 schools made it easier to comprehend the different types of usages within HTML and CSS. It was useful as it breaks down each compound, elements, and structure methods into its own page or subsection as going through detail to detail on how it works within both HTML and CSS.</p>
        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Styling colors and fonts can be both applied to the headers, bodys, and titles.</li>
            <li>Can change various of elements within the code with different fonts, sizing, and colors depending on each line of the code that was input.</li>
            <li>Aligning text is very simple as this can shift the text in different directions such as to the left, right, or center.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Some of the sourses that I used to have a better understanding</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp"> HTML Styles CSS by w3 Schools</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp"> CSS Selectors by w3 Schools</a></li>
        </ul>
