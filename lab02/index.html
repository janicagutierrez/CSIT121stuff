    <h1>Learning Web Standards</h1>
    <h2> Labs 1 & 2</h2>
    <p><i> Published on September 2025 by Janica Gutierrez</i></p>
    <p>This is my first webpage! Starting the process was not that hard as I took a smiliar class back in high school so I had prior knowledge about making websites through HTML codes. But, I am still learning new ways when using HTML or remembering how to. As of right now, I am properly learning on how to make my webpages from scratch through HTML and adapting new styles.</p>
    <h3>What I learned</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Structuring my webpage more neatly. Meaning, using different headers so it is easier to section off different topics.</li>
        <li>Inserting various of lists to make a more neater and simpiler look.</li>
        <li>Using the "a href" code to insert links where a user can click on it. This is very handy as I can link different sources in a webpage.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Learning about structuring, listings, and links was very exciting and useful to know! As I learnt alot from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Structuring_documents">HTML Semantic Elements by w3 Schools</a></p></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">HTML Links Hyperlinks by w3 Schools</a></li>
    </ul>
